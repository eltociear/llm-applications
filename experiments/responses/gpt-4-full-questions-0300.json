This can be done by injecting your custom model or action distributions into Catalogs. \n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Construct your own model logic by subclassing either TFModelV2 (for TensorFlow) or TorchModelV2 (for PyTorch). \n\n2. Register and specify your subclass in the config. \n\n3. In the config, you can specify the name of your custom model in the \"custom_model\" field. \n\n4. You can pass extra options to the custom classes through the \"custom_model_config\" field. These options will be available to the Model's constructor in the model_config field and will also be attempted to be passed as **kwargs to ModelV2 models.\n\n5. If you have a custom action distribution, specify its name in the \"custom_action_dist\" field.\n\nRemember that custom preprocessors are deprecated, so it's recommended to use a wrapper class instead. \n\nFor example, in the constructor of the PPOTorchRLModule, Catalogs are used to build models as follows:\n\n```python\ncatalog = self.config.get_catalog()\n\n# Build models from catalog\nself.encoder = catalog.build_actor_critic_encoder(framework=self.framework)\nself.pi = catalog.build_pi_head(framework=self.framework)\nself.vf = catalog.build_vf_head(framework=self.framework)\n```\n\nThis is how you can add custom models to your RLModule."

            "answer": "In Ray, you can use an actor to run a specific function at a regular interval. An actor is a stateful worker (a process), and you can define methods inside this actor to perform specific tasks. \n\nHere is a basic example of how to create an actor and run a function:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Runner:\n    def __init__(self, env_name, actor_id):\n        self.env = env = create_env(env_name)\n        self.id = actor_id\n        self.policy = LSTMPolicy()\n        self.runner = RunnerThread(env, self.policy, 20)\n        self.start()\n```\n\nIn this example, `Runner` is an actor that starts a simulation environment, policy, and thread when initialized. \n\nTo run a specific function at a regular interval, you can use a loop inside the actor method. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Sleeper:\n    def __init__(self, sleepValue):\n        self.sleepValue = sleepValue\n\n    def actor_func(self):\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(self.sleepValue)\n```\n\nIn this example, `actor_func` is a method inside the `Sleeper` actor that sleeps for a specified interval. This function runs at a regular interval defined by `sleepValue`.\n\nTo call this function, you can use the `remote` method:\n\n```python\nactor_example = Sleeper.remote()\nactor_example.actor_func.remote()\n```\n\nThis will start the `actor_func` method in the `Sleeper` actor, which will run at a regular interval. \n\nPlease note that the actor runs asynchronously, and the order of function calls is maintained within the actor. Also, Ray provides features for actor scheduling, fault tolerance, and concurrency control."

Placement groups in Ray allow you to atomically reserve groups of resources across multiple nodes. These reserved resources can then be used by tasks or actors that use the PlacementGroupSchedulingStrategy. The resources are distributed according to the placement strategies across nodes on the cluster. However, each bundle of resources must be able to fit on a single node on the Ray cluster. If a bundle cannot fit in any of the current nodes, the entire placement group is not ready and no resources are reserved."

It automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand. When the resource demands of the workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler will try to increase the number of worker nodes. Conversely, when worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler will remove worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler only reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. \n\nIn the context of Kubernetes, the KubeRay operator can automatically configure an autoscaling sidecar container for the Ray head pod if 'enableInTreeAutoscaling' is set to true. This autoscaler container collects resource metrics from the Ray cluster and automatically adjusts the replicas field of each workerGroupSpec as needed to fulfill the requirements of your Ray application. The fields 'minReplicas' and 'maxReplicas' can be set to constrain the number of replicas of an autoscaling worker group. \n\nThe Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler makes scaling decisions based on the logical resources expressed in container resource requests. The Ray autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups."

Monitor your application: Use the Ray Serve metrics like `ray_serve_http_request_latency_ms`, `ray_serve_grpc_request_latency_ms`, and `ray_serve_multiplexed_model_load_latency_ms` to monitor the latency of your requests. High values could indicate performance issues.\n\n3. Debug performance issues: If you notice `serve_num_router_requests` staying constant while your load increases or `serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms` spiking up as queries queue up in the background, it could indicate high latency and/or low throughput for requests. \n\n4. Check your hardware and resources: Make sure you are using the right hardware and resources for your application's needs. \n\n5.

This is important for speeding up the data collection process, especially when dealing with multiple environments.\n\nOn the other hand, num_cpus_per_worker determines the number of CPUs allocated per Learner worker. This is only necessary for custom processing pipelines inside each Learner requiring multiple CPU cores. \n\nTherefore, if your task involves complex computations that require multiple CPU cores, num_cpus_per_worker might be more important. However, if your task involves collecting data from multiple environments, num_rollout_workers might be more important. \n\nIt's also worth noting that if num_gpus_per_learner_worker is set, then num_cpus_per_learner_worker cannot be set. This suggests that the allocation of resources between CPUs and GPUs also plays a crucial role in the performance of the task."

This parameter determines the threshold for throwing a warning when no active trials are in the RUNNING state due to insufficient resources. \n\nRemember that the autoscaler only considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization.

For example, in the first code snippet, a TensorFlow dataset is created with a batch size of 2, which means each batch of data will contain 2 examples. The features and labels for each batch are then printed out. The shapes of these tensors are (2,) which means they are 1-dimensional tensors with 2 elements each. \n\nIn another code snippet, a tensor is created with np.ones() and then multiplied by np.expand_dims(np.arange(0, 10), tuple(range(1, 1 + len(tensor_shape)))). This could potentially create a tensor of shape (500, 2) depending on the value of tensor_shape. \n\nWithout more specific information about where the error is occurring, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.

This forces the task or actor to be placed on a node with that particular accelerator type available. \n\nCurrently, only \"cpu\" and \"gpu\" are supported as accelerator types.

These results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed. \n\nYou can also report metrics and checkpoints with `train.report`. This tracks these metrics in Ray AIR\u2019s internal bookkeeping, allowing you to monitor training and analyze training runs after they\u2019ve finished.\n\nFor persisting your checkpoints and monitoring training progress, you can add a utility callback to your Trainer. If you're using PyTorch Lightning, you can use `ray.train.lightning.RayTrainReportCallback`. If you're using Hugging Face Transformers, you can use `ray.train.huggingface.transformers.RayTrainReportCallback`.\n\nHere is an example of how to add the callback:\n\n```python\nimport pytorch_lightning as pl\nfrom ray.train.lightning import RayTrainReportCallback\n\ndef train_func(config):\n    ...\n    trainer = pl.Trainer(\n        ...\n        callbacks=[..., RayTrainReportCallback()],\n    )\n    ...\n```\n\nThe `_session_report` method is called whenever a new checkpoint is created.

This function is designed to flatten arbitrary input structures according to a given spaces structure, resulting in a single 1D tensor. \n\nThe error could be due to the input data not matching the expected structure or dimensions. For example, if the input tensor has a size of 10, but the function is trying to reshape it into a shape that requires a size of 3, this error will occur. \n\nTo fix this, you should ensure that the input data matches the expected structure and dimensions. If the input is a tensor, it should have a size that is divisible by the shape you are trying to reshape it into.

You can build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code.\n\n3. **Incorporate Business Logic**: Because Serve supports any arbitrary Python code, you can write all steps of your chatbot application as a single Python module. This includes prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, API calls, and response validation.\n\n4. **Optimization**: Ray Serve has features for batching and can integrate with any model optimization technique. This helps improve the performance of your chatbot application.\n\n5. **Streaming Responses**: Ray Serve supports streaming responses, a key feature for chatbot-like applications. This allows your chatbot to handle user interactions in real-time.\n\n6. **Deployment**: Deploy your Ray Serve chatbot application to production. Each application step can independently autoscale to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources.\n\n7. **Scaling**: Ray Serve is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs. This allows you to serve many chatbot models at a low cost.\n\nRemember to test your chatbot thoroughly before deployment to ensure it's working as expected."

Ray uses an object store for memory management, where objects are reference counted and evicted when they fall out of scope. However, the object store allocates a certain percentage of host memory (30% by default) to shared memory. This memory allocation can give the impression of monotonically increasing memory usage, especially when Ray workers access objects in the object store using ray.get, which increases shared memory usage.

In the case of PPO, each worker collects samples 'rollout_fragment_lenth' samples in 'num_env_per_workers'. And there are 'num_workers' number of workers. So, this sampling stage produces a train (full) batch, which is then divided into smaller mini batches, each of which is in the size of 'sgd_minibatch_size'. And then a minibatch is randomly selected, which is used to update the value and policy network. This update stage is iterated 'num_sgd_iter' times. These all stages occur in one (algorithm) iteration. And the next iteration starts with new sampling stage without using any sample collected in the previous step. This is the data collection and how they are used in the PPO training. I just want to know such cases in SAC in RLlib.",

            "answer": "In RLlib's Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the data collection and usage process is similar to PPO, but with some differences due to the off-policy nature of SAC. \n\nLike PPO, SAC uses multiple workers (defined by 'num_workers') to collect samples. Each worker collects 'rollout_fragment_length' samples in 'num_envs_per_worker'. These samples are then sent back to the main process and stored in a replay buffer. \n\nHowever, unlike PPO, SAC does not discard the samples after each training iteration. Instead, it stores them in the replay buffer for future use. This is a key characteristic of off-policy algorithms like SAC, which allows them to learn from past experiences.\n\nThe training batch is then formed by sampling a set of experiences from the replay buffer. The size of this batch is determined by the 'train_batch_size' parameter. This batch is used to update the policy and value networks. \n\nThe update stage is iterated 'num_sgd_iter' times, similar to PPO. However, the mini-batch size for each update ('sgd_minibatch_size') can be different from the 'rollout_fragment_length', as it is sampled from the entire replay buffer, not just the most recent samples.\n\nAfter the update, the samples remain in the replay buffer and can be reused in future training iterations. This process continues for the specified number of training iterations. \n\nIn summary, the main difference between SAC and PPO in terms of data collection and usage is the use of a replay buffer in SAC, which allows it to reuse past experiences for training."

You can find the head node address from the cluster page.\n\n2. Check the memory usage from the head node from the node memory usage view inside the Dashboard metrics view.\n\n3. If you find that the head node is running out of memory, you can increase the heap space available by increasing the memory in the spark cluster. This can be done by changing instance types or worker count, reducing the target `num_worker_nodes`, or applying a lower `object_store_memory_worker_node`.\n\n4. You can also adjust the `object_store_memory_head_node` parameter. This represents the object store memory available to the Ray head node, but it is capped by \u201cdev_shm_available_size * 0.8\u201d. The default value equals to \u201c0.3 * spark_driver_physical_memory * 0.8\u201d.\n\n5. Use the `head_node_options` to pass extra options to the ray start script. Convert ray start options key from --foo-bar format to foo_bar format. For flag options (e.g. \u2018\u2013disable-usage-stats\u2019), set the value to None in the option dict, like {\"disable_usage_stats\": None}.\n\n6. If you're using a Kubernetes cluster, you can update the machine-type and the resource requirements in the ray-cluster.gpu.yaml file to allocate more memory to the head node.\n\n7. If you're using the autoscaler, you can adjust the `head_resources` parameter in the cluster configuration to allocate more resources to the head node.\n\nRemember, these changes are only hints to the autoscaler. The actual resulting cluster size may be slightly larger or smaller than expected depending on the internal bin packing algorithm and max worker count restrictions."

            "answer": "Yes, you can use ray.wait on a workflow task. The ray.wait function allows you to process tasks in the order they finish, which can speed up the total time to completion. This function is particularly useful when you have multiple tasks that take different amounts of time to complete. Instead of waiting for all tasks to finish with ray.get(), you can use ray.wait() to know which tasks have finished executing without blocking on all of them. This can help limit the number of pending tasks and prevent out-of-memory errors. However, keep in mind that no durability guarantees apply to the tasks or actors used within the task; if the task fails, it will be re-executed from scratch."

            "answer": "To serve a cluster locally, the minimum requirements include:\n\n1. Networking Configuration: End users should only need to directly interact with the head node of the cluster. Two services should be exposed to users: The dashboard and The Ray client server. While users only need 2 ports to connect to a cluster, the nodes within a cluster require a much wider range of ports to communicate. Applications (such as Ray Serve) may also require additional ports to work properly.\n\n2. Hardware Specification: A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster. Metrics that are useful for deciding the hardware specification are CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage. The head node should have sufficient bandwidth. \n\n3. Resource Requirements: These are hard requirements meaning that only feasible nodes are eligible to run the task or actor. If all nodes are infeasible, the task or actor cannot be scheduled until feasible nodes are added to the cluster.\n\n4. Environment: When making the transition from your local machine to a remote cluster, you\u2019ll need to make sure your cluster has a similar environment to your local machine\u2013files, environment variables, and Python packages, for example.\n\n5. Ray Address: In the examples, the Ray address commonly used is localhost:6379. If the Ray cluster is already started, you should not need to run anything on the worker nodes."

If you don't need GPU support or ML dependencies, consider using the \"rayproject/ray:latest-cpu\" image as it's faster to pull. \n\nIf you're still encountering issues, it might be due to permission errors when using py-spy inside a Docker container.

They can be a class conforming to the Trainable interface or a function that is wrapped into a Trainable class. The function is executed on a separate thread. Ray Tune associates each trial with its own Trainable, which is a remote actor that can be placed on any node in a Ray cluster. The most commonly used type of trainable is the function trainable API, which is a Python function containing model training logic and metric reporting."

This means that you provide a list of lists, where each inner list contains a timestep and the corresponding learning rate value. Intermediary timesteps will be assigned to interpolated learning rate values. A schedule should normally start from timestep 0. \n\nHere is an example of how to set it:\n\n```python\nlr_schedule=[[0, 1e-3], [500, 5e-3]]\n```\n\nIn this example, the learning rate starts at 0.001 at timestep 0 and decreases to 0.005 at timestep 500.

Use Ray Serve's framework-agnostic feature: Ray Serve can serve everything from deep learning models built with frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras, to Scikit-Learn models, to arbitrary Python business logic. It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc.\n\n3. Use Ray Serve's multi-model composition: Ray Serve supports multi-model composition using a programmable API where calls to different models look just like function calls. The models can use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster.\n\n4. Optimize performance: Ray Serve has features for batching and can integrate with any model optimization technique. It also supports streaming responses, a key feature for chatbot-like applications.\n\n5. Deploy your model: Serve allows you to deploy your models as multiple deployments. A deployment handles incoming requests and replies with a result. This deployment can be exposed over HTTP.\n\nRemember, Ray Serve is well suited for model composition, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It supports complex model deployment patterns requiring the orchestration of multiple Ray actors, where different actors provide inference for different models. Serve handles both batch and online inference and can scale to thousands of models in production."

In your training script, import the necessary modules and classes:\n```python\nfrom ray.tune.logger import TBXLoggerCallback\n```\n\n3. Create an instance of `TBXLoggerCallback` and pass it to your training function or experiment configuration.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it in a training script:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import train\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig, RunConfig\nfrom ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer\nfrom ray.tune.logger import TBXLoggerCallback\n\ndef train_func():\n    for i in range(3):\n        train.report(dict(epoch=i))\n\n# Create a TBXLoggerCallback instance\ntbx_callback = TBXLoggerCallback()\n\n# Pass the callback to your training function or experiment configuration\ntrain.run(train_func, callbacks=[tbx_callback])\n```\n\nAfter running your experiment, you can visualize your results with TensorBoard by specifying the output directory of your results:\n```\n$ tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results/my_experiment\n```\n\nPlease note that the `TBXLoggerCallback` class automatically flattens nested dicts to show on TensorBoard. For example, `{\"a\": {\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2}}` will be shown as `{\"a/b\": 1, \"a/c\": 2}` on TensorBoard."

In the context of Ray, tasks can be defined in several ways:\n\n1. Each node in the original Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) becomes a workflow task. These tasks are wrappers around Ray tasks that insert checkpointing logic to ensure intermediate results are durably persisted.\n\n2. Tasks can be defined as stateless functions that execute asynchronously and run in parallel. For example, a sampling task in Ray can be defined to do the sampling up to a certain number of samples and return the number of samples that are inside a certain boundary.\n\n3. Tasks can also be defined as operations on objects or actors. For example, incrementing a counter a certain number of times can be defined as a task. These tasks can be executed serially and share state.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a job detail page can only display or retrieve up to 10K tasks per job. For jobs with more than 10K tasks, the tasks that exceed the 10K limit are unaccounted. The number of unaccounted tasks is available from the task breakdown."

This means that even in a single-agent scenario, you can use this replay buffer to store and retrieve experiences.\n\nThe replay buffer configuration allows you to modify the behavior of the underlying replay buffers. For example, you can specify an alternative underlying replay buffer with a different capacity, storage unit, number of shards, replay mode, and other parameters. This is done through the \"underlying_buffer_config\" parameter in the replay buffer configuration.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a MultiAgentReplayBuffer with an alternative underlying ReplayBuffer:\n\n```python\nconfig = (\n    DQNConfig()\n    .replay_buffer(MultiAgentReplayBuffer, {\n        \"underlying_buffer_config\": {\n            \"capacity\": 50000,\n            \"storage_unit\": \"timesteps\",\n            \"num_shards\": 2,\n            \"replay_mode\": \"independent\",\n            \"replay_sequence_length\": 5,\n            \"replay_burn_in\": 10,\n            \"replay_zero_init_states\": False,\n        }\n    })\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the MultiAgentReplayBuffer is configured with an underlying replay buffer that has a capacity of 50,000 timesteps, is divided into 2 shards, uses independent replay mode, has a sequence length of 5, a burn-in of 10, and does not initialize states to zero."

For example:\n```python\nprint(requests.get(\"http://localhost:8000/\").json())\n```\nThis will print the response from your model.\n\n3. If you are using a multiplexed model, you need to include the `serve_multiplexed_model_id` in the request header. The value should be the model id you want to send the request to. For example:\n```python\nresp = requests.get(\n    \"http://localhost:8000\", headers={\"serve_multiplexed_model_id\": str(\"1\")}\n)\n```\nThis will send a request to the model with id \"1\" and store the response in `resp`.\n\nThe `handle_request` method is the entry point that takes in the request\u2019s prompt and calls the `run_model` method on it. The `run_model` method is a generator that handles batching the requests. The generated tokens can be streamed back to the client."

It returns an ordered iterator that will return results of the map as they finish. You must iterate over the iterator to force the computation to finish.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def my_method(self, i):\n        return i * 2\n\n# Initialize a pool of actors\nactors = [MyActor.remote() for _ in range(10)]\npool = ray.util.ActorPool(actors)\n\n# Use ActorPool.map to apply 'my_method' in parallel over the actors and values\nresults = pool.map(lambda a, v: a.my_method.remote(v), range(100))\n\n# Iterate over the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_method` is applied to each value in the range from 0 to 99. The computation is performed in parallel using the actors in the pool. The results are printed as they become available.\n\nNote: The `@ray.remote` decorator is used to define a remote class (an actor) that can be instantiated in the Ray cluster. The `my_method` method of the `MyActor` class is a remote method that can be invoked on any actor instance. The `remote()` method is used to create an actor or invoke a remote method, and it returns a future that can be used to retrieve the result."

            "answer": "To map a list to a remote deployment in parallel, you can use the Ray Serve library. First, you need to define a deployment that takes in a list of input strings and runs vectorized text generation on the inputs. This can be done by creating a class decorated with @serve.deployment and defining a method that handles the batch of inputs. \n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\n@serve.deployment\nclass BatchTextGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, pipeline_key: str, model_key: str):\n        self.model = pipeline(pipeline_key, model_key)\n\n    @serve.batch(max_batch_size=4)\n    async def handle_batch(self, inputs: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        print(\"Our input array has length:\", len(inputs))\n\n        results = self.model(inputs)\n        return [result[0][\"generated_text\"] for result in results]\n```\n\nTo execute your Ray task remotely, you must use a .remote() call. Ray executes remote tasks asynchronously, even on a local cluster. The items in the object_references list in the code snippet do not directly contain the results. If you check the Python type of the first item using type(object_references[0]), you see that it is actually an ObjectRef. These object references correspond to futures for which you need to request the result.\n\nIf the data needs to be divided across multiple nodes, the map phase is useful. To apply the map phase to the corpus in parallel, we use a remote call on apply_map, similar to the previous examples. The main difference is that we want three results returned (one for each partition) using the num_returns argument.\n\n```python\nmap_results = [\n    apply_map.options(num_returns=num_partitions)\n    .remote(data, num_partitions)\n    for data in partitions\n]\n```\n\nThis way, you can map a list to a remote deployment in parallel using Ray Serve."

This can be done by specifying a `CheckpointConfig` with a `checkpoint_frequency`. For example:\n\n```python\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    MyTrainableClass,\n    param_space={\"input_size\": 64},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        stop={\"training_iteration\": 2},\n        checkpoint_config=train.CheckpointConfig(checkpoint_frequency=2),\n    ),\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\n\nThis will save the state of the experiment to a user-specified persistent storage location at the specified frequency. If a trial fails, Ray Tune will automatically restart it from the latest checkpointed state.\n\nAnother way is to manually save and load checkpoints using Ray Tune\u2019s Function API. You can create a checkpoint using `from_dict()` or `from_directory()` APIs. However, when using `from_directory`, the content of the checkpoint will be copied and moved to a tune managed folder, which may cause some inefficiency when the checkpoint is synced to the driver node or the cloud.\n\nNote that function checkpointing is disabled by default. To enable it, set the train function arguments to be `func(config, checkpoint_dir=None)`. If function checkpointing is not enabled, it may result in unexpected behavior when using checkpointing features or certain schedulers."

However, just setting the \"custom_model\" field in the configuration is not enough. You also need to provide any necessary parameters for your custom model in the \"custom_model_config\" field. \n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\nfrom ray.rllib.models import ModelCatalog\n\n# Register your custom model\nModelCatalog.register_custom_model(\"my_model\", MyModel)\n\n# Specify the custom model and its parameters in the configuration\nconfig = {\n    \"model\": {\n        \"custom_model\": \"my_model\",\n        \"custom_model_config\": {\n            # Add any necessary parameters for your custom model here\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Use the configuration with Tune.fit\ntune.fit(DQNTrainer, config=config)\n```\n\nIn this example, \"MyModel\" is the custom model class that you want to use. You need to replace it with your actual custom model class. Also, you need to replace DQNTrainer with the actual trainer you are using.\n\nIf you are still having issues, make sure your custom model is correctly implemented and registered, and that you are providing all the necessary parameters in the \"custom_model_config\" field."

            "answer": "Apache Spark and Ray are both distributed data processing frameworks, but they have some key differences. Apache Spark is often used for batch processing workloads, while Ray Data, built on top of Ray, is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference due to its streaming paradigm. Ray Data scales effectively to large clusters and offers scheduling support for both CPU and GPU resources. It uses streaming execution to efficiently process large datasets. However, unlike Spark, Ray Data does not have a SQL interface and is not meant as a replacement for generic ETL pipelines. Ray is built for offline batch jobs and simplifies the process by eliminating the need for starting servers or sending HTTP requests. \n\nOn the other hand, Spark on Ray (RayDP) combines Spark and Ray clusters, allowing large scale data processing using the PySpark API and seamless use of that data to train models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. RayDP enables the use of Spark inside a Ray program, allowing for data reading, processing using SQL, Spark DataFrame, or Pandas (via Koalas) API, feature extraction and transformation using Spark MLLib, and distributed training on the preprocessed dataset using the RayDP Estimator API."

The `rollout_workers` can be either local or remote. The local worker is usually used for learning, while the remote workers are used for sample collection. The number of `rollout_workers` can be controlled by the `num_workers` parameter. \n\nIn summary, `num_workers` controls the number of workers used for sample collection, while `rollout_workers` are the workers (both local and remote) that execute the rollouts."

For example, if you want to set the number of CPUs to 2, you would use `ray.init(num_cpus=2)`. This will override the default setting which is based on the number of virtual cores detected by Ray. \n\nYou can also set the number of CPUs when starting Ray from the command line using the `--num-cpus` flag. For example, `ray start --num-cpus=10` will set the number of CPUs to 10. \n\nIn a multi-worker setting, Ray sets the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=<num_cpus>` if `num_cpus` is set on the task/actor via `ray.remote()` and `task.options()/actor.options()`. If `num_cpus` is not specified, Ray sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` to avoid performance degradation with many workers. You can override this by explicitly setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.\n\nIn a Kubernetes environment, you can specify the number of CPUs available to the Ray pod using the `num-cpus` field. The CPU count can be autodetected from the Kubernetes resource limits specified in the group spec\u2019s pod template. However, you can override this autodetected value by setting `num-cpus:\"0\"` for the Ray head pod to prevent Ray workloads with non-zero CPU requirements from being scheduled on the head.

            "answer": "The issue with your Ray Tune Bayesian optimization search stopping after only a single trial could be due to several reasons. One possible reason could be the configuration of the `patience` parameter in your `BayesOptSearch` class. The `patience` parameter determines the number of steps without improvement after which the search is stopped. If it's set to a low value, the search might stop prematurely. \n\nAnother possible reason could be the `random_search_steps` parameter. This parameter determines the number of initial random steps taken before the Bayesian optimization begins. If this is set to a low value, the optimization might not have enough initial data to effectively guide the search, leading to early termination.\n\nLastly, the `skip_duplicate` parameter could also be a factor. If it's set to `True`, the search will skip configurations that have been tried before. If your search space is small, it's possible that the search is stopping because all configurations have been tried once.\n\nPlease check these parameters in your `BayesOptSearch` configuration."

If the queue accepts a checkpoint object, it will be saved using `wandb.log_artifact()`.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef save_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_dir):\n    path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, \"checkpoint\")\n    with open(path, \"wb\") as outputFile:\n        pickle.dump((self.config, self.nthread, self.model.save_raw()), outputFile)\n```\n\nThis code will save the checkpoint to the specified directory. The checkpoint includes the configuration, the number of threads, and the raw model data. The data is pickled for efficient storage. \n\nRemember to replace the `self.config`, `self.nthread`, and `self.model.save_raw()` with your actual data that you want to save in the checkpoint."

Use the Ray Jobs API: The Ray Jobs API is the recommended way to run a job on a Ray cluster. It consists of a CLI tool, Python SDK, and a REST API. It allows you to submit locally developed applications to a remote Ray Cluster for execution. A submission to the Ray Jobs API consists of an entrypoint command, like python my_script.py, and a runtime environment, which specifies the application\u2019s file and package dependencies.\n\n2. Create a minimal cluster config YAML: Create a YAML file named cloudwatch-basic.yaml with the necessary configurations. This includes the provider type (AWS), region, availability zone, and a cloudwatch section to enable CloudWatch integration with your Ray cluster.\n\n3. Use RayJob for deployment on public cloud providers: If you're deploying on public cloud providers like AWS, use RayJob. It allows automatic deletion of the RayCluster upon job completion, helping you reduce costs.\n\n4. Monitor with Amazon CloudWatch: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights to monitor your applications. CloudWatch integration with Ray requires an AMI (or Docker image) with the Unified CloudWatch Agent pre-installed. AMIs with the Unified CloudWatch Agent pre-installed are provided by the Amazon Ray Team.\n\n5. Run Ray\u2019s XGBoost training benchmark: You can run Ray\u2019s XGBoost training benchmark with a 100 gigabyte training set. To learn more about using Ray\u2019s XGBoostTrainer, check out the XGBoostTrainer documentation."

Each RLlib algorithm has its own config class that inherits from AlgorithmConfig. For instance, to create a PPO algorithm, you start with a PPOConfig object, to work with a DQN algorithm, you start with a DQNConfig object, etc.\n\nTo change the behavior of RLlib\u2019s default models, you can override the default model config settings and pass it to an AlgorithmConfig. The default model config settings include options for the FullyConnectedNetworks (fcnet_hiddens and fcnet_activation), VisionNetworks (conv_filters and conv_activation), auto-RNN wrapping, auto-Attention (GTrXL) wrapping, etc.\n\nHere is an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nconfig = PPOConfig()\nconfig.model.fcnet_hiddens = [64, 64]\nconfig.model.fcnet_activation = 'relu'\nconfig.model.conv_filters = [[16, [8, 8], 4], [32, [4, 4], 2], [512, [11, 11], 1]]\nconfig.model.conv_activation = 'relu'\n```\n\nThis will set the fully connected network to have two hidden layers with 64 units each and ReLU activation, and the convolutional network to have three layers with specific filter and stride settings and ReLU activation."

This can be done by creating a class for your model and defining an `__init__` method. In this method, load the pretrained model and tokenizer using the `from_pretrained` method and the model ID.\n\n```python\nclass LargeModel:\n    def __init__(self, model_id):\n        self.model_id = model_id\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(self.model_id)\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model_id)\n        self.tokenizer.pad_token = self.tokenizer.eos_token\n```\n\n3.

This can include loss functions, optimizers, and accuracy metrics.\n\n```python\nself.loss_object = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()\nself.optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\nself.train_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean(name=\"train_loss\")\nself.train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name=\"train_accuracy\")\nself.test_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean(name=\"test_loss\")\nself.test_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name=\"test_accuracy\")\n```\n\n4. If you're using your model for inference, you can use the `Checkpoint` returned by Ray Train. This involves training a model with Ray Train, saving the model, and then using it for batch inference with Ray Data.\n\n5. If you're using Population Based Training (PBT), you can visualize the optimization process and adapt the model weights from top-performing trials.\n\nRemember to adapt these steps based on the specific model and task you're working on."

It allows you to combine the flexibility of Ray\u2019s dynamic task graphs with strong durability guarantees. You can branch or loop conditionally based on runtime data and use Ray distributed libraries seamlessly within workflow tasks. Ray Workflows offers sub-second overheads for task launch and supports workflows with hundreds of thousands of tasks. It also allows you to take advantage of the Ray object store to pass distributed datasets between tasks with zero-copy overhead. Workflows can be launched from within a Ray task or actor, and workflow tasks can use Ray tasks or actors within a single task.\n\nOn the other hand, Ray Serve Deployments are focused on deploying business logic or machine learning models to handle incoming requests and can be scaled up to run across a Ray cluster. A deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load. To define a deployment, you use the @serve.deployment decorator on a Python class (or function for simple use cases)."

For single-agent algorithms (e.g., PPO, DQN) or independent multi-agent algorithms (e.g., PPO-MultiAgent), use `RLModule`. For more advanced multi-agent use cases with shared communication between agents, extend the `MultiAgentRLModule` class.\n\n5. RLlib treats single-agent modules as a special case of `MultiAgentRLModule` with only one module. Create the multi-agent representation of all RLModules by calling `as_multi_agent()`.\n\n```python\nimport gymnasium as gym\nfrom ray.rllib.core.rl_module.rl_module import SingleAgentRLModuleSpec\n```\n\n6. Convert your custom gym environments into a multi-agent one and start training your agents in any of the following fashions: Cooperative with shared or separate policies and/or value functions, adversarial scenarios using self-play and league-based training, or independent learning of neutral/co-existing agents.\n\nRemember that the specific implementation details will depend on your specific use case and the requirements of your RL agents."

If an object is already present on the node, this does not cause additional allocations, allowing large objects to be efficiently shared among many actors and tasks. \n\nHowever, each node has its own object store and data put into the object store does not get automatically broadcasted to other nodes. The data remains local to the writer until requested by another task or actor on another node. \n\nIf you're running multi-node training, ensure that all nodes have access to a shared storage, such as NFS or EFS. You can adjust this location with the DATA_PREFIX environment variable. \n\nIn Ray, tasks and actors create and compute on objects, referred to as remote objects. These objects can be stored anywhere in a Ray cluster and are referred to using object refs. Remote objects are cached in Ray\u2019s distributed shared-memory object store, with one object store per node in the cluster. A remote object can live on one or many nodes, independent of who holds the object ref(s)."

Load the checkpoint and the tuned hyperparameters. The checkpoint contains the state of the trained algorithm, and the hyperparameters are the optimized parameters obtained from the tuning process.\n\n2. Continue training the model using these loaded parameters. You can use the `train_func` function for this purpose. This function takes a configuration parameter containing the hyperparameters and starts a full training run. It creates the model and optimizer and repeatedly calls the train function to train the model.\n\n3. During the training process, you can save checkpoints at regular intervals. This is controlled by the `checkpoint_interval` parameter in the `train_func` function. You can also log the training progress at regular intervals, controlled by the `logging_interval` parameter.\n\n4. After the training is complete, you can save the state of the trained algorithm in a checkpoint using the `algo.save` function.\n\nThis process allows you to continually train the hyperparameters.

Run prediction on the data:\n\n```python\npredictions = model.predict(data)\n```\n\nNote: The exact method to run prediction may vary depending on the type of model you are using. The above example assumes a model with a `predict` method, which is common for many machine learning models.\n\nAlso, remember that Ray AIR replaces Transformers checkpointing, so `load_best_model_at_end` must be set to False. You can obtain the AIR Checkpoint with `Result.checkpoint` returned by the `fit()` method of the Trainer, and the model itself by calling `Checkpoint.get_model()`. You can configure the checkpointing by setting `run_config.checkpoint_config`."

This could be a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher. \n\nBefore deploying, you need to generate a Serve config YAML file. This file is the single source of truth for the cluster, allowing you to specify system-level configuration and your applications in one place. It also allows you to declaratively update your applications. The 'serve build' CLI command takes as input the import path and saves to an output file using the -o flag. \n\nServe makes it easy to go from a laptop to a cluster. You can test your models (and your entire deployment graph) on your local machine before deploying it to production on a cluster. You don\u2019t need to know heavyweight Kubernetes concepts or cloud configurations to use Serve. \n\nIn terms of best practices, it's important to understand how to operate Serve in production, manage Serve with the Serve CLI, and configure your HTTP requests when querying Serve. Serve enables you to rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy scalable LLM applications to production. Each application step can independently autoscale to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources."

However, it can be manually set to optimize the application, for example, ray.data.read_parquet(path, parallelism=1000) would force up to 1000 read tasks to be created. This can be beneficial in certain scenarios to enhance performance. However, the parallelism is upper bounded by the total number of records in all the parquet files."

            ],
            "answer": "The slowdown you're experiencing when using Ray on your personal computer to calculate a simple function could be due to several factors. Firstly, every task invocation in Ray has a non-trivial overhead, including scheduling, inter-process communication, and updating the system state. This overhead can dominate the actual time it takes to execute the task, especially for simple functions. \n\nSecondly, Ray determines the number of CPUs on your machine using psutil.cpu_count() and usually will not schedule more tasks in parallel than the number of CPUs. So, if your computer has 8 cores, the most you should expect is an 8x speedup. However, if the tasks are not highly parallelizable or if the overhead of scheduling and communication between tasks is high, you may not see a significant speedup. \n\nLastly, it's important to note that the number of logical cores can be different from the number of physical cores. If your machine has fewer physical cores than logical cores, this could also affect the performance. \n\nIn conclusion, while Ray can be used for complex parallelization tasks, for simple functions the overhead associated with task invocation can result in slower execution times compared to a sequential program."

This feature allows your application to automatically scale based on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that deploying with KubeRay requires Kubernetes admin permissions.

            "answer": "In Ray, you can chain remote functions with dependencies by calling one remote function inside another. This is also known as nested remote functions. When a task depends on the output of another task, Ray ensures that the dependent task will not be executed until the necessary outputs (also known as object references) are ready.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef f(x):\n    return x + 1\n\n@ray.remote\ndef g(x):\n    return f.remote(x)\n\n# Call g function with an argument\nresult = ray.get(g.remote(1))  # This will return 2\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `g` calls the function `f`. When `g` is called, it will wait for `f` to complete before it completes. The `ray.get` function is used to retrieve the actual result.\n\nThe `ray.remote` decorator is used to declare that a function is a remote function. This means that calls to the function will immediately return a future (an object reference) and that the actual execution will take place asynchronously (potentially on a different machine)."

Explicitly specify the number of CPUs (`num-cpus`) and number of GPUs (`num-gpus`) to Ray to prevent it from using more resources than allocated. Also, indicate the `node-ip-address` for the Ray head runtime. For example:\n\n```bash\nport=6379\nip_head=$head_node_ip:$port\nexport ip_head\necho \"IP Head: $ip_head\"\n```\n\n3.

Execute all commands on all nodes in the Docker container and open all the necessary ports to support the Ray cluster. Use the Docker image `rayproject/ray-ml:latest-gpu` (or `latest-cpu` if you don't need GPU support and want a faster startup). Name the container \"ray_container\".

Define your configuration: Use the `ray.tune.TuneConfig` to define the hyperparameters you want to tune. \n\n```python\nconfig = {\n    \"lr\": tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1),\n    \"batch_size\": tune.choice([2, 4, 8, 16])\n}\n```\n\n3.

Use `ray.tune.Tuner`: Initialize a `ray.tune.Tuner` object with your training function and configuration. \n\n```python\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_yolo, config)\n```\n\n5. Fit the model: Call the `fit` method on the `Tuner` object to start the hyperparameter tuning process.\n\n```python\ntuner.fit()\n```\n\n6. Restore the best model: After the tuning process is finished, you can restore the best model using the `restore` method.\n\n```python\nbest_model = tuner.restore()\n```\n\n7. Use `ray.tune.with_parameters`: If your training function requires additional parameters that should not be tuned, you can use the `with_parameters` function.\n\n```python\ntune.run(tune.with_parameters(train_yolo, data=data), config=config)\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a general guide and might need adjustments based on your specific use case. Also, YOLO v8 is a hypothetical version used for this example, as the latest version of YOLO at the time of writing is YOLO v4."

Each replica maintains a queue of requests and executes them one at a time, potentially using asyncio for concurrent processing. If the handler function is declared with async def, the replica will not wait for the handler to run, allowing for concurrent handling of requests. The number of ongoing requests that a replica can handle concurrently is determined by the 'target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica' parameter. The system also ensures that no replica is handling more than 'max_concurrent_queries' requests at a time. If there are no available replicas, the request is left in the queue until a replica becomes available. The system also has autoscaling capabilities, scaling up if the number of ongoing requests per replica is lower than the target, and scaling down if it's higher."

If you don't want to schedule child tasks and actors to the same placement group when `placement_group_capture_child_tasks` is True, you can specify `PlacementGroupSchedulingStrategy(placement_group=None)`.\n\nPlease note that this feature is not yet implemented for Java APIs."

For example, a remote function 'g' can call another remote function 'f' multiple times and return the resulting object references. Another remote function 'h' can call 'f' multiple times, block until those tasks finish, retrieve the results, and return the values. This is done using the ray.get() function."

It computes the action logits using the policy and the observations from the batch. Then, it samples actions from a categorical distribution defined by these logits. The actions are then masked and structured as a nested dictionary similar to the action logits using the `tree.unflatten_as` function. The method returns a dictionary containing the masked actions and the action logits. \n\nPlease replace `YOUR_DIST_CLASS` with the actual distribution class you are using, and add the logic for masking the actions where indicated."

This strategy will attempt to distribute the tasks or actors evenly across the available nodes in the cluster. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. For tasks, use the `@ray.remote` decorator and specify the scheduling strategy as \"SPREAD\". For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func():\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\n\n2. For actors, use the `@ray.remote` decorator to define your actor class, and then use the `options` method with the scheduling strategy set to \"SPREAD\" when creating instances of your actor. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_cpus=1)\nclass SpreadActor:\n    pass\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\n\nThe \"SPREAD\" scheduling strategy is a best-effort approach to distribute tasks or actors evenly across the cluster. It's particularly useful for improving performance in Ray Data, as it ensures that data blocks and map tasks are balanced across the cluster."

Each scheduler is described in the Tune documentation and they all take in a metric, which is a value returned in the result dict of your Trainable and is maximized or minimized according to mode. \n\nFor example, the AsyncHyperBandScheduler or ASHAScheduler samples a number of hyperparameter configurations. Each of these configurations is trained for a specific number of iterations. After these iterations, only the best performing hyperparameters are retained. These are selected according to some loss metric, usually an evaluation loss. This cycle is repeated until we end up with the best configuration. \n\nThe ASHA scheduler can be used by setting the scheduler parameter of tune.TuneConfig, which is taken in by Tuner. Other schedulers include HyperBandScheduler, MedianStoppingRule, PopulationBasedTraining, PopulationBasedTrainingReplay, Population Based Bandits (PB2), HyperBandForBOHB, ResourceChangingScheduler, and FIFOScheduler (Default Scheduler)."

            "answer": "The fake multinode docker node provider offers fully functional nodes in their own containers. However, it does not support configurations for authentication, setup, initialization, Ray start, file sync, and anything cloud-specific. It is necessary to limit the number of nodes, node CPU, and object store memory to avoid overloading your local machine. In docker-in-docker setups, a careful setup has to be followed to make the fake multinode docker provider work.\n\nFor multi-node training, all nodes should have access to a shared storage, such as NFS or EFS. The location can be adjusted with the DATA_PREFIX environment variable. The autoscaler in fake multi-node mode supports most features, such as updating the YAML file for new configurations and applying changes, as it does in a real cluster. Node selection, launch, and termination are governed by the same bin-packing and idle timeout algorithms as in a real cluster.\n\nIf there are multiple inputs to the deployment graph, they can be provided by accessing attributes of InputNode. The data types for each of these inputs must be one of the supported input data types.\n\nFor a single-node multi-GPU setup, distributed training is needed to leverage all GPUs. For a multi-node multi-GPU setup, one worker per GPU needs to be scheduled. The placement of bundles on the same or different nodes depends on the value of `placement_strategy`, which can be \"PACK\", \"SPREAD\", or \"STRICT_PACK\"."

For example, if your machine has 4 CPUs and you want your actor to use all of them, you would do:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_cpus=4)\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\n```\n\nThis will reserve 4 CPU cores for the lifetime of the actor.

            "answer": "The error message \"ValueError: Operator must be started before being shutdown\" typically indicates that an operation is being attempted on an object that has not been properly initialized or started. In the context of your code, it seems like you're trying to use the `map_batches` function from the `ray.data.Dataset` module.\n\nThe `map_batches` function applies a given function to each batch of records in the dataset. The function should take in a batch and return a batch. The batches are either tables (default), pandas DataFrames, or dictionaries of numpy arrays, depending on the `batch_format` argument.\n\nThe error might be due to the function `get_pd_value_counts` or `BatchInferModel` not being properly initialized or started before being used in `map_batches`. Make sure these functions are correctly defined and initialized before being used.\n\nAlso, ensure that the `ray.data.Dataset` object (`dataset` or `ds`) is properly initialized and has data before calling `map_batches` on it. If the dataset is empty or not properly initialized, it might lead to this error.\n\nIf you're using actors with `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy()`, make sure the actors are started before being used. The error might be due to the actors being shutdown before they are started.\n\nWithout the exact code and context, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. But these are some general directions you can look into to debug the issue."

            "answer": "AsyncIO can be used for actors in FastAPI endpoints to manage concurrent code execution. This is possible since Python 3.5, which introduced the async/await syntax. Ray, a popular framework, natively integrates with asyncio and can be used alongside other async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. \n\nIn FastAPI, using async def for endpoint functions can help control the workload performance and prevent issues like out-of-memory errors or resource starvation that can occur when many requests are running simultaneously in one replica.\n\nHowever, asyncio may not be the ideal solution for every actor. For instance, if a method performs a computation-heavy task that blocks the event loop without giving up control via await, it can hurt the performance of an Async Actor. In such cases, the max_concurrency Actor options can be used to achieve threaded concurrency, similar to a thread pool.\n\nHere is an example of how to use AsyncIO for actors in FastAPI:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    # multiple invocation of this method can be running in\n    # the event loop at the same time\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `run_concurrent` method of the `AsyncActor` class can have multiple invocations running in the event loop at the same time. This is achieved by using the `async def` syntax and the `await` keyword."

            "answer": "The error you're encountering is due to not binding the DAG node to a deployment. In the context of using the DAG API with Ray Serve, you need to bind the output of your DAG to a deployment. This is done using the `bind()` method. \n\nIn your provided code, you have correctly used the `bind()` method for the `Model` class instances in the `nodes` list. However, if you're still getting the error, it means there might be other parts of your code where you're using the DAG API but haven't bound the DAG node to a deployment.\n\nThe error message suggests that you should do something like this: `app = Deployment.bind(my_dag_output)`. Replace `Deployment` with the name of your deployment class and `my_dag_output` with the output of your DAG. This will bind the DAG node to the deployment and should resolve the error."

            "answer": "To compute actions to evaluate the model with the given action space, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check the type of the action space. If it's a Box space, ensure it's not an integer type. If it's an integer type, raise a ValueError. If the Box space has more than one dimension, raise an UnsupportedSpaceException.\n\n2. If the action space is valid, you can generate deterministic actions. Multiply the high limit of the action space with a tensor of ones that has the same shape as the deterministic actions.\n\n3. Define a function to get the exploration action. If exploration is enabled, get the required model output shape for the action distribution. If the shape of the action distribution inputs matches the required shape with an additional batch dimension, generate a batch of sample actions from the action space.\n\n4. Sample actions from the action distribution.\n\n5. Create an instance of the distribution class with the distribution inputs and the model.\n\n6. Get the exploration action from the forward results. This will return the actions and their log probabilities."

            "answer": "To add a custom success metric while training a set of RL agents and use an ExperimentAnalysis to rank them, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define your custom metrics in your training loop. In the provided context, the custom metrics are \"Q\", \"theta0\", \"theta1\", \"h0\", \"h1\", and \"train_step\". You can define your own metrics based on your requirements.\n\n```python\nresult = {\n    \"Q\": Q(theta),\n    \"theta0\": theta[0], \"theta1\": theta[1],\n    \"h0\": h0, \"h1\": h1,\n    \"train_step\": train_step,\n}\n```\n\n2. Report these metrics at each training iteration using `train.report(result, checkpoint=checkpoint)`. This will make these metrics available for analysis later.\n\n3. After the training is complete, you can use Ray's `ExperimentAnalysis` to analyze the results. You can get the metrics for each trial using `analysis.trial_dataframes`, which returns a dictionary mapping trial IDs to dataframes containing the reported metrics for each training iteration.\n\n4. To rank the agents, you can use the `get_best_trial` method of `ExperimentAnalysis`, which returns the trial with the best performance on the provided metric. For example, if \"Q\" is your success metric, you can use `analysis.get_best_trial(\"Q\")` to get the trial (and thus the agent) with the highest \"Q\" value.\n\nRemember that the custom metrics you define should be relevant to the success of your RL agents. For example, if you're training agents to play a game, a useful metric might be the average score the agent achieves in each game."
