By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays. However, you can return either NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames from your function.\n\nHere's an example of how to increase the brightness of an image batch using NumPy:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n```\n\nTo avoid potential out-of-memory situations, make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large. Additionally, when calling `ds.map_batches()`, ensure that the batch size is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory.\n\nYou can also explore other methods like `flat_map()` and `map_batches()` for transforming data in Ray.",

This is done by the Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process. \n\nFor example, in a Kubernetes environment, the Ray autoscaler can adjust the number of Ray pods in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The autoscaler scales the cluster up or down as needed to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ray Serve Autoscaling allows the minimum number of replicas (min_replicas) to be set to 0 when starting the deployment. The scale-up process will be triggered when traffic is sent to the application. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request.\n\nTo learn more about Ray autoscaling, you can refer to the documentation on Ray Autoscaler with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler. Additionally, Ray Serve offers features for batching, model optimization, and streaming responses, which can further improve the performance of your applications.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

The `config_space` defines the hyperparameter search space. The `tune.run` function is used to perform hyperparameter tuning, specifying the `train_fn`, the `config_space`, the number of samples to try (`num_samples`), and the resources per trial (in this case, 1 GPU).\n\nBy using Ray Tune, you can easily parallelize the training of multiple models and efficiently search for the best hyperparameters.",
