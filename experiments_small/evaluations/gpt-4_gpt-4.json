Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. You can return either format from your function. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use `map_batches()`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `increase_brightness` takes a batch of data (represented as a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays) and increases the brightness of the \"image\" field.\n\nAlso, be aware of the memory management. Large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.",

This is done by the Ray autoscaler, a Ray cluster process. The autoscaler scales the cluster up and down based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. In the context of Ray Serve, the autoscaler allows the min_replicas to be 0 when starting your deployment, and the scale-up process begins when you start sending traffic. There will be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, meaning it asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",
