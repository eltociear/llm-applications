The autoscaling feature in Ray Serve increases or decreases the number of replicas to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources. The Serve Autoscaler runs in the Serve Controller actor and reacts to task and actor resource requests, rather than application metrics or physical resource utilization. To configure autoscaling in a Ray application, you can use the Ray autoscaler, which is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes. The Ray autoscaler automatically scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. For more information on configuring autoscaling, you can refer to the user guides for Ray clusters on VMs and Kubernetes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

The client address format is `ray://<head-node-ip>:10001`, and the Ray dashboard address format is `http://<head-node-ip>:8265`.
