Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default.\n2. To configure the batch type, you can specify `batch_format` in the `map_batches()` function. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n3. If you want to work with NumPy ndarrays, you can import `Dict` and `numpy` and define your function accordingly. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n```\n\n4. You can also use the `take_batch` method to inspect inputs to `map_batches`. This method returns up to `batch_size` rows from the `Dataset` in a batch. Note that `take_batch` moves the rows to the caller's location.\n\nI hope this advice helps you with your Ray Data type conversions when using `map_batches`!",

            "generated_answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically adjusting the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resource demand. The Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process, scales the cluster up and down based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. \n\nFor example, in a Kubernetes environment, the Ray autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resource demand. \n\nIt is worth noting that in Ray Serve Autoscaling, the minimum number of replicas can be set to 0 when starting the deployment. The scaling up process will be triggered when traffic is sent to the application. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the incoming requests.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Instead of using `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` to retrieve the result of a Ray task, you can use `await` to wait for the completion of the task. \n\nFor example, instead of:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n    return 1\n\nray.get(some_task.remote())\nray.wait([some_task.remote()])\n```\n\nYou can do:\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n    return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n    await some_task.remote()\n    await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])\n\nasyncio.run(await_obj_ref())\n```\n\nThis allows you to integrate Ray tasks with async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. You can also use `await` with Ray actors to run multiple invocations of a method concurrently in the event loop.\n\nExample:\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# Regular ray.get\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n\n# Async ray.get\nasync def async_get():\n    await actor.run_concurrent.remote()\n\n# Run the async_get function\nasyncio.run(async_get())\n```\n\nPlease refer to the asyncio documentation for more information.",
