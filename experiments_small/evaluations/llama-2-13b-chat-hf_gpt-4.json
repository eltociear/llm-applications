The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler.\n2. The Ray Serve Autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand.\n3. The Ray Autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n4. The Ray Serve Autoscaler can be configured with min_replicas set to 0, allowing the scale up to be started when the application starts receiving traffic.\n5. There will be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits (blocks) for available replicas to assign the request.\n6. The Ray Serve Autoscaler can be used in conjunction with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for more advanced scaling capabilities.\n7. The Ray Serve Autoscaler supports batching and can integrate with any model optimization technique to improve the performance of LLM applications.\n8. The Ray Serve Autoscaler also supports streaming responses, which is a key feature for chatbot-like applications.\n9. The autoscaler can be configured with limits on CPU and memory resources, and can be tested and developed using the autoscalerOptions suboptions.\n\nIn summary, the Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and allows for the scaling of replica actors based on request demand. It can be configured with min_replicas set to 0 and supports batching and streaming responses. Additionally, it can be used in conjunction with the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for more advanced scaling capabilities.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Based on the context you provided, it seems like you are looking for an example of using the Ray AIR library for data-parallel training of CNNs on Ray.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use Ray AIR to train a CNN on the MNIST dataset using data parallelism:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray import tune\nfrom ray.tune.schedulers import get_scheduler\nfrom ray.tune.train import Train\n\n# Define the training configuration\ntrain_config = {\n    \"model\": {\n        \"class\": \"your_model_class\",\n        \"config\": {\n            \"num_classes\": 10,\n            \"hidden_dim\": 256,\n            \"num_layers\": 3,\n            \"batch_size\": 32,\n            \"epochs\": 10\n        }\n    },\n    \"train_dataset\": \"path/to/mnist_dataset\",\n    \"train_batch_size\": 32,\n    \"eval_batch_size\": 16,\n    \"evaluation_frequency\": 2,\n    \"num_workers\": 4,\n    \"init\": {\n        \"learning_rate\": 0.001,\n        \"weight_decay\": 0.0005\n    }\n}\n\n# Create a Ray AIR context\nray_air_context = tune.train.AirContext(\n    train_config,\n    num_workers=4,\n    scheduler=get_scheduler(\"fair_share\")\n)\n\n# Create a Train object\ntrain = Train(\n    ray_air_context,\n    model=your_model_class,\n    train_dataset=train_config[\"train_dataset\"],\n    train_batch_size=train_config[\"train_batch_size\"],\n    eval_batch_size=train_config[\"eval_batch_size\"],\n    evaluation_frequency=train_config[\"evaluation_frequency\"]\n)\n\n# Train the model\ntrain.train()\n```\nIn this example, we define a training configuration that specifies the model, dataset, and training parameters. We then create a Ray AIR context using the `tune.train.AirContext` class, which sets up the distributed training environment and schedules the training runs. Finally, we create a `Train` object using the `train` method, which trains the model using the specified training configuration and dataset.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the training configuration and other parameters depending on your specific use case.

            "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that you are asking about how to use Ray's `await` keyword to wait for the results of remote tasks.\n\nRay provides two ways to wait for the results of remote tasks:\n\n1. Using `ray.get()`: This method blocks the current thread until the task is completed and returns the result. You can use `await` keyword to wait for the result of `ray.get()`.\n2. Using `asyncio.wait()`: This method returns a list of completed tasks, including the result of the remote task. You can use `await` keyword to wait for the result of `asyncio.wait()`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use `await` to wait for the results of remote tasks:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef f(i):\n    return i\n\nasync def main():\n    tasks = [f(i) for i in range(4)]\n    results = await asyncio.wait(tasks)\n    print(results)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ray.init()\n    main()\n```\nIn this example, `main()` is an asynchronous function that creates four remote tasks using `f(i)` and waits for their results using `asyncio.wait()`. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the results of the remote tasks.\n\nIt's important to note that using `await` to wait for the results of remote tasks can lead to deadlocks if not used carefully. It's recommended to use `asyncio.wait()` instead of `await` to wait for the results of remote tasks, as it allows for more flexibility and control over the asynchronous execution of tasks.\n\nAdditionally, you can use `ray.get()` instead of `asyncio.wait()` to wait for the results of remote tasks. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef f(i):\n    return i\n\nasync def main():\n    tasks = [f(i) for i in range(4)]\n    results = await ray.get(tasks)\n    print(results)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ray.init()\n    main()\n```\nIn this example, `main()` is an asynchronous function that creates four remote tasks using `f(i)` and waits for their results using `ray.get()`. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the results of the remote tasks.\n\nPlease refer to the Ray documentation and the asyncio documentation for more information on how to use `await` and `asyncio.wait()` to wait for the results of remote tasks.",

Additionally, Ray does not support priorities, so all jobs, tasks, and actors have the same priority.\n\nIf you need to ensure that tasks or actors use no more resources than specified via resource requirements, you can use operating system APIs like sched_setaffinity to pin a task to a physical CPU.\n\nOverall, it's important to carefully manage resource requirements and usage in Ray to avoid issues like OOM and ensure reliable and efficient job execution.",

However, it includes some additional information that is not directly related to the question, such as the lack of support for priorities in Ray and the use of operating system APIs to pin a task to a physical CPU. This extra information, while potentially useful, is not necessary to answer the question and could potentially confuse the reader.",

However, it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For long running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.",
