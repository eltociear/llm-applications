            "question": "I\u2019m struggling a bit with Ray Data type conversions when I do map_batches. Any advice?",
            "generated_answer": "When using Ray Data type conversions with `map_batches`, there are a few things to keep in mind. \n\nFirst, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. To configure the batch type, you can specify the `batch_format` parameter in `map_batches()`. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n\nIf you are working with large datasets, be cautious of potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nTo transform batches with tasks, you can call `map_batches()`. Ray Data uses tasks by default. You can define a function that takes a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays as input and returns a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays as output. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness)\n)\n```\n\nYou can also specify the batch format in methods like `Dataset.iter_batches()` and `Dataset.map_batches()` to specify the batch type. For example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\ndataset = ray.data.range(10)\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"numpy\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output: {'id': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])}\n\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"pandas\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output:\n#    id\n# 0   0\n# 1   1\n# 2   2\n# 3   3\n# 4   4\n```\n\nWhen working with Torch tensors, transformations applied with `map` or `map_batches` can return Torch tensors. However, under the hood, Ray Data automatically converts Torch tensors to NumPy arrays. Subsequent transformations accept NumPy arrays as input, not Torch tensors.\n\nIf your tensors vary in shape, Ray Data represents batches as arrays of object dtype. The individual elements of these object arrays are regular ndarrays.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you want to use NumPy ndarrays, you can specify batch_format='numpy'.

            "question": "How does autoscaling work in a Ray Serve application?",
            "generated_answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically adjusting the number of replicas for a deployment based on its load. The Ray Serve autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler, interacts with the Ray Autoscaler to start or stop replica actors based on the demand for requests. If there are not enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, scales the cluster up by increasing the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity. Conversely, it removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. In Ray Serve Autoscaling, the minimum number of replicas can be set to 0, and the scale-up process starts when traffic is received. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request. It's important to note that the autoscaler responds to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. For more information on autoscaling, you can refer to the user guides for Ray clusters on VMs and Kubernetes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",
