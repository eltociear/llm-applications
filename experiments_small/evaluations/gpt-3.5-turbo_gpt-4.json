            "generated_answer": "If you're struggling with Ray Data type conversions when using `map_batches`, here are a few tips:\n\n1. Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default.\n2. You can configure the batch type by specifying `batch_format` in the `map_batches()` function. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n3. Make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large to avoid potential out-of-memory situations. Also, ensure that the batch size you pass to `map_batches()` is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory.\n4. If you need to create new rows from existing ones, you can use the `flat_map()` method.\n5. If you have an expensive setup like downloading model weights, consider using actors. Otherwise, use tasks. You can transform batches with tasks by calling `map_batches()`, which is the default behavior for Ray Data.\n\nI hope these tips help you with your Ray Data type conversions and `map_batches` usage!",

            "generated_answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by adjusting the number of nodes or replicas in the cluster based on the resource demand of tasks, actors, or placement groups. The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales the cluster up and down. \n\nFor Kubernetes deployments, the Ray autoscaler can be configured to adjust the number of Ray pods in the cluster based on resource demand. The autoscaler starts scaling up when traffic is sent to the deployment, and there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request.\n\nThe Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. This allows each application step to independently autoscale to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources.\n\nAdditionally, Ray Serve has features for batching, model optimization, and streaming responses, which are beneficial for improving the performance of applications.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Once the cluster is started, the command will print the address of the head node in the format `<head-node-address>:<port>`. For example, it may look something like `123.45.67.89:6379`.\n\n3. On each of the other nodes, run the command `ray start --address=<head-node-address:port>`, replacing `<head-node-address:port>` with the value printed by the command on the head node.

Instead of using `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` to retrieve the result of a Ray task, you can use `await` to wait for the result. For example, instead of `ray.get(some_task.remote())`, you can do `await some_task.remote()`.\n\nIn the provided context, there are examples of using `await` with Ray futures.

It allows you to leverage a remote Ray cluster just like you would with Ray running on your local machine. However, Ray Client has architectural limitations and may not work as expected when using Ray for ML workloads. In such cases, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs API for interactive development on ML projects. Ray Client requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For production usage or non-changing environments, it is recommended to install dependencies into a container image and specify the image using the Cluster Launcher. For dynamic environments, such as development and experimentation, runtime environments are recommended.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Client should be used when you want to connect an interactive Python shell to a remote cluster. It is useful for developing interactively in a local Python shell. However, it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For long running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.",
