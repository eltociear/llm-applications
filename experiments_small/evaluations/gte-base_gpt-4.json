            "generated_answer": "If you're struggling with Ray Data type conversions when using `map_batches`, here are a few tips:\n\n1. Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default.\n2. You can configure the batch type by specifying `batch_format` in the `map_batches()` function. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n3. Make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large to avoid potential out-of-memory situations. Also, ensure that the batch size you pass to `map_batches()` is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory.\n4. If you need to create new rows from existing ones, you can use the `flat_map()` method.\n5. If you have an expensive setup like downloading model weights, consider using actors. Otherwise, use tasks. You can transform batches with tasks by calling `map_batches()`, which is the default behavior for Ray Data.\n\nI hope these tips help you with your Ray Data type conversions and `map_batches` usage!",

The Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process, automatically scales the cluster up and down. This scaling is done based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nFor Kubernetes deployments, the Ray autoscaler can be configured using the KubeRay Autoscaling guide. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resource demand.\n\nIn Ray Serve, the autoscaling feature allows the minimum number of replicas to be set to 0 when starting the deployment. The scaling up process will be triggered when traffic is sent to the application. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request.\n\nThe Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It requests Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the demand for requests.\n\nOverall, autoscaling in a Ray Serve application allows the cluster to dynamically adjust its size to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources. It can be configured and optimized based on specific performance requirements, such as latency constraints and end-to-end latency objectives.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Ray Client requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For production usage or non-changing environments, it is recommended to install dependencies into a container image and specify the image using the Cluster Launcher. For dynamic environments, such as development and experimentation, runtime environments are recommended.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Client should be used when you want to connect an interactive Python shell to a remote cluster. It is useful for developing interactively in a local Python shell. However, it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For long running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.",
