            "generated_answer": "When using Ray Data type conversions with `map_batches`, there are a few things you can keep in mind:\n\n1. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays. However, you can configure the batch type by specifying `batch_format` in `map_batches()`. You can choose to return either NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames from your function.\n\n2. When defining your function for `map_batches`, make sure to specify the input and output types correctly. For example, you can use `Dict[str, np.ndarray]` as the input type and `Dict[str, np.ndarray]` or `DataBatch` as the output type.\n\n3. It's important to consider memory management when working with Ray Data. Large block sizes can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid this, ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `map_batches()` with a batch size that can comfortably fit into memory.\n\n4. If you need to create new rows from existing ones, you can use the `flat_map()` method instead of `map()`. Unlike `map()`, a function passed to `flat_map()` can return multiple rows.\n\nOverall, pay attention to the data types, configure the batch format as needed, and consider memory limitations to ensure smooth execution with Ray Data type conversions in `map_batches()`.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function.

The Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process, handles this scaling process. \n\nFor example, in a Kubernetes environment, the Ray autoscaler adjusts the number of Ray pods in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The autoscaler scales the cluster up or down as needed to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ray Serve Autoscaling allows the minimum number of replicas (min_replicas) to be set to 0 when starting the deployment. The scaling up process will be triggered when traffic is sent to the application. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request.\n\nOverall, autoscaling in a Ray Serve application allows for efficient resource allocation and can be combined with other features such as batching and model optimization techniques to improve performance.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The min_replicas and max_replicas fields configure the range of replicas which the Serve autoscaler chooses from. The target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica configuration specifies how aggressively the autoscaler should react to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

The `config` dictionary defines the hyperparameters to be tuned. The `tune.run` function is used to perform the data-parallel training, specifying the training function, configuration space, number of samples, and resources per trial.\n\nNote that this example assumes you have already implemented the `train` and `test` functions for training and evaluating your CNN model on the MNIST dataset.",
